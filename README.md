# RAG-based Teaching Assistant

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline
that converts lecture videos into searchable knowledge using embeddings
and cosine similarity.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Whisper
- FFmpeg
- Vector embeddings
- Cosine similarity

## Note on Data
Audio, video, embeddings, and generated JSON files are excluded from
this repository due to size constraints. Refer to the README for
instructions on reproducing results locally.
