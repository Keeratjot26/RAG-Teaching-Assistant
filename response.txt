You're looking for information on matrix multiplication. From what I could gather, it seems like a topic that's covered in both "The Geometry of linear Equations" and "Properties of Determinants".

In "The Geometry of linear Equations", you'll find a brief mention of matrix multiplication starting at around 194 seconds into the video. It appears to be mentioned as a way to combine two matrices, with an example given that involves finding the sum of products of corresponding elements in each matrix.

On the other hand, the topic of "Matrix multiplication" is explored more thoroughly in "Properties of Determinants". Starting at about 12 seconds into this video, you'll see a discussion on how matrix multiplication relates to determinants and permutation matrices. This section seems to provide more detailed information on the properties and applications of matrix multiplication.

If I'm correct that these videos are part of the same course, I'd recommend starting with "The Geometry of linear Equations" (around 194 seconds in) if you want a brief introduction to matrix multiplication. However, for a more comprehensive understanding, I'd suggest diving into "Properties of Determinants" (starting at around 12 seconds in).
